# Gait-Analysis
Feature Extraction From Image Sequences For Gait Analysis

# About

Implemented algorithm using python image processing library to extract GAIT features using RAW data from IR Sensors. Using image segmentation techniques and edge detection techniques to detect contours for each of the images. The walking features are extracted and analyzed, examined to determine walk speed, stride length, step length.'

Gait Analysis is essential to study of human motion; we intend to understand the typical human walking pattern and provide treatment if this pattern has changed over time. The experimental setup consists of 25 infrared cameras spaced at 4 inches (0.1 m) apart. The research includes data preprocessing step, image segmentation, and edge detection to extract features like gait speed, stride, and step length. The features determined from the walking pattern will provide valuable data for additional analysis. A total of over 600 samples were collected (6 different persons -100 different walkpatterns)

# NOTE
For testing purpose only sample images were included and not entire data set
